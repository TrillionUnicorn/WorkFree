## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

### Option A: Run Tests First (Recommended)
1. Run Playwright tests on current MVP
2. Fix any issues found
3. Ensure 100% pass rate
4. Then create MVP variations

### Option B: Create All MVPs First
1. Create MVP-2 (Enterprise)
2. Create MVP-3 (Educational)
3. Create MVP-4 (Healthcare)
4. Create MVP-5 (Gaming)
5. Test all MVPs together

### Option C: Iterative Approach
1. Create MVP-2 → Test → Fix → PR
2. Create MVP-3 → Test → Fix → PR
3. Create MVP-4 → Test → Fix → PR
4. Create MVP-5 → Test → Fix → PR

---

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED APPROACH

I recommend **Option C (Iterative)** because:
1. Ensures each MVP is perfect before moving to next
2. Allows for learning and improvements
3. Easier to manage and review
4. Lower risk of accumulating issues
5. Better for GitHub PR workflow

### Estimated Timeline
- **MVP-2 (Enterprise):** 2-3 hours
- **MVP-3 (Educational):** 2-3 hours
- **MVP-4 (Healthcare):** 2-3 hours
- **MVP-5 (Gaming):** 2-3 hours
- **Testing & Fixes:** 2-4 hours
- **Total:** 10-16 hours
