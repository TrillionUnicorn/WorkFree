## Known Limitations

### Environment Constraints
⚠️ **Note:** Playwright tests require a graphical environment with browser support. In the current development environment (Docker container without display), tests are configured but cannot execute.

**Solution for Local Testing:**
1. Clone repository to local machine
2. Install dependencies: `bun install`
3. Install Playwright browsers: `bunx playwright install`
4. Run tests: `bun run test`

### Alternative Verification
Since automated tests cannot run in this environment, we have:
1. ✅ Manual code inspection completed
2. ✅ Build verification successful
3. ✅ TypeScript check passed
4. ✅ Server running and accessible
5. ✅ All components verified in code
