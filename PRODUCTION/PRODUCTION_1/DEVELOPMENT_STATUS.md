## üìù NOTES

### Technical Decisions
- **Why SQLite?** Fast, simple, perfect for local development and small-medium deployments
- **Why Lucia Auth?** Modern, type-safe, flexible authentication library
- **Why Drizzle ORM?** Type-safe, performant, great DX
- **Why Bun?** 3x faster than Node.js, all-in-one toolkit

### Architecture Decisions
- **Route Groups:** Using (auth) and (app) for organization
- **Server Load Functions:** For data fetching and protection
- **Svelte 5 Runes:** Using modern reactive syntax
- **Glass Morphism:** For modern, premium UI feel

### Performance Considerations
- Database queries optimized with indexes
- Lazy loading for quest content
- Efficient session management
- Minimal bundle size with SvelteKit
