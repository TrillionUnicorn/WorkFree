# Complete Development Plan - WorkFree Production

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Timeline:** 8-10 weeks  
**Approach:** Build 2 completely different production versions simultaneously

---

## OVERVIEW

We will build **TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT** production versions:

1. **PRODUCTION_1:** Modern stack (SvelteKit + Bun + Cloudflare)
2. **PRODUCTION_2:** Enterprise stack (Next.js + Node + Vercel)

**Why Two Versions?**
- Compare performance, cost, developer experience
- Have backup if one approach fails
- Learn best practices from both
- Merge best elements into final version
