## PRODUCTION_1: Modern Stack

**Technology:**
- Frontend: SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5
- Runtime: Bun 1.3+
- Database: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Hosting: Cloudflare Pages + Workers
- Cost: ~$105/month at 10K users

**Advantages:**
- 3x faster development
- 54% lower infrastructure costs
- Smaller bundle sizes
- Better performance

---

## PRODUCTION_2: Enterprise Stack

**Technology:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + React 18
- Runtime: Node.js 20 LTS
- Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- Hosting: Vercel + Supabase
- Cost: ~$230/month at 10K users

**Advantages:**
- Larger ecosystem
- More developers available
- Enterprise-proven
- Better tooling

---

## WHY TWO VERSIONS?

### Real-World Scenario
Simulating two independent development teams building the same product:
- Team A: Modern, cutting-edge stack (PRODUCTION_1)
- Team B: Proven, enterprise stack (PRODUCTION_2)

### Benefits
1. **Risk Mitigation:** If one approach fails, we have a backup
2. **Best Practices:** Learn from both implementations
3. **Performance Comparison:** Real benchmarks, not assumptions
4. **Cost Analysis:** Actual infrastructure costs
5. **Developer Experience:** Which stack is more productive?

### Final Decision
After building both, we'll:
1. Compare feature completeness
2. Benchmark performance
3. Analyze costs
4. Evaluate maintainability
5. Merge best elements into final production version
